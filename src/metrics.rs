//! Metrics data structures for slow-rs.
//!
//! This module defines the [`Metrics`] struct which holds all collected
//! system performance data, as well as intermediate data structures used
//! during collection.

use serde::Serialize;

/// Complete snapshot of system metrics at a point in time.
///
/// This struct is serialized to CSV for logging. All fields are designed
/// to help diagnose system slowdowns by providing visibility into various
/// subsystems.
///
/// # Field Categories
///
/// - **Timestamps**: When the measurement was taken
/// - **Benchmarks**: Active performance tests (I/O, compute, memory)
/// - **Memory**: RAM and swap usage details
/// - **CPU**: Usage percentages and time breakdowns
/// - **Disk I/O**: Read/write statistics from the kernel
/// - **Network**: Traffic and error counters
/// - **Pressure (PSI)**: Linux pressure stall information
/// - **Temperatures**: Hardware thermal sensors
/// - **VM Stats**: Virtual memory and paging statistics
