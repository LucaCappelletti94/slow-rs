/// System slowness diagnostic monitor.

/// slow-rs continuously monitors system performance metrics and runs
/// benchmarks to help diagnose mysterious system slowdowns. It can
/// identify issues related to:
///
/// - Disk I/O problems (failing drives, high latency)
/// - Memory pressure (swapping, OOM conditions)
/// - CPU issues (thermal throttling, steal time in VMs)
/// - General resource exhaustion
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```bash
/// # Run with TUI interface (default)
/// slow-rs
///
/// # Run in headless mode with 10-second intervals
/// slow-rs --headless -i 10
///
/// # Enable I/O benchmark for disk throughput testing
/// slow-rs --io-bench
/// ```
